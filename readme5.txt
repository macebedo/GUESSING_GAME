This is not a tutorials. There are my codes created for the request below:

Number Guessing Game – Write a script that will guess the number a user entered from 1 to 999. Users can only enter whole numbers, but you need to validate the entry.  If the number entered is valid, continue with your guesses.  If the input is not valid, inform the user without making any guess attempts.

Your script is NOT allowed to evaluate the users input for anything other than logical comparisons such as greater than, less than or equal to.

You have a maximum of 10 guesses.

Each guess from your script will result in two lines of output:

1) an indication of what number is being guessed
2) an indication of the result of the guess compared to the users number – guess is greater than the number, guess is less than the number or guessed the right number

Each set of guess output will be numbered to indicate how many guesses have been made.

If you guess the number in 10 or fewer guesses, let the user know you won.  If you don’t guess the number in 10 guesses, let the user know they won.

Output to the user is to be done using innerHTML so both lines of each guess output is in their own paragraph.  All guesses are to remain on the screen at the end of each game – don’t overwrite a previous guess.
